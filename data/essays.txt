0 the coral bleaching is a different type they are bleached and coral bleaching
0 the bleached is plain white
0 the coral polyps give different colors
0 the skeleton protects the body of polyp
0 the process requires both carbon dioxide and release oxygen
0 they know about changes wind ocean currents and temperature
0 this event occurred in num
0 blue color is water temperature
0 red color is trade wind strength
0 the fishermen worked along pacific coastal regions of south america for centuries
0 normal water temperature will be num degrees fahrenheit
0 ocean water temperature will be num to num degrees fahrenheit
0 the oxygen is o2
0 the carbon dioxide co2
0 the necessary will be coral healthy
1 during bleaching corals turn white due to the ejection or death of their algae
 
0 coral bleaching rates vary at different times
0 the pacific trade winds go from east to west
0 the winds move the warm surface waters westward
0 these warm waters got together north of australia near papua new guinea
0 at the same time the deeper and colder waters in the eastern pacific rise to the surface
0 this is called upwelling
0 i did not know any of this
1 upwelling causes colder temperature in surface waters
0 when i read more i learned that algae needs to have a certain temperature to stay alive and also healthy
0 coral bleaching is when algae die
1 the coral loses its color because the algae gave it the color in the first place
 
0 the thing that bleaches corals are losing algae or very little algae
 coral bleaching is an example of how environmental sources can negatively affect the relationship between corals and their algae
 coral bleaching rates vary at different types depending on the weather
 coral bleaching happens by the corals losing their algae
 also it happens when the corals start losing their color and start turning plain white
 why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 it because the water temperature
 also if its winter or fall the rates lower
 if its high one it higher like summer or spring
 by this time now the corals are going to turn white because its getting colder
 in conclusion the stuff that bleaches corals are losing algae
 that might happen in fall or winter time because the sun gives salt to the algae for them to eat
 so they would die if they didnt get sun
 also the rates change in different times because every day not num degrees
 its always different because the corals eat from the algae and if they die because of the cold weather than that probably means the corals are going to die
0 that is my answer
 
0 coral bleaching happens at different times
 for this to happen it depends on certain things
 like for example one certain way is the temperature
 i think the temperature is something that really affects the coral bleaching
 it probably affects it because if it isnt the right temperature it might die or start changing color
 another think that can cause coral bleaching are the changes in wind
 changes in wind is also a very important thing that can cause coral bleaching
 it might cause coral bleaching because when the wind changes the temperature will change
 for example in the text it says normal water temperature in these regions is num degrees fahrenheit
 however when surface water shift eastward ocean water temperatures increase by num degrees fahrenheit
 so when there are changes in wind the temperature changes
 like i was saying before if the temperature changes it will also cause coral bleaching
 a lot of stuff can cause coral bleaching
 thats why the colors change
 i never knew all the stuff that can cause it
 some of the stuff are changes in wind temperatures and ocean currents
 
 the rates vary at different times for many reasons
 one of the reasons that it varys is which way the trade winds are going 
 also higher water temperature could affect it
 those are my reasons
 i saw on the graph the lowest trade winds was the same year as when more than seventy countries reported coral bleaching
 trade winds is wind that goes east to west
 that changes every couple years
 that is how it might affect it
 the graph showed in num the higher the water temperature the higher the coral bleaching
 those are my thoughts about coral bleaching
 
 there are different ways coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 first coral bleaching is something that give the corals their colors
 some coral have lost their color and have been bleached plain white
 for me coral bleaching mainly means losing the color
 that is what coral bleaching means
 coral bleaching changes by its color
 the author said that the coral bleaching changes
 the bleaching changes a lot or less throughout the years
 the biggest coral bleaching was on the yearl of num
 in each year on the graph there are different things
 the author said that people often mistake for a rock or a plant
 coral is mainly made up from tiny animals called polyps
 in my opinion i am amazed that animals make coral
 i wondered how tiny little animals do the coral
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times depending on how much algae are their
 the reason the corals need algae is because they prey on algae
 if they dont get algae it leads the coral to have discoloration and they turn white
 the problem is the algae is not always there
 this is because winds blow it east to west
 also water levels increase to about several inches to a foot
 there is no certain routine for when this happens so it happens at very different times
 
 well coral bleaching is bad because the coral has its beautiful color
 the coral bleach is bad for those bleachers takes the color and the food that they eat
 this is really bad for coral life
 the corals need their color
 plus they need food
 for they could obviously survive
 the is a living thing
 the passage states however some coral have lost their color and been bleached as plain white
 well plus they coral dont get food they have a process of photosynthesis
 they need light to eat out the ocean could turn of num to num degrees
 so they need to have light to eat
 the passage states they have know about changes in wind temperatures
 this affects coral it takes there color away
 then it takes their food away to
 plus if the corals are bleached they are not healthy
 the passage states during bleacing corals turn white due to eject or death of their algae
 so algae gives it its color
 finally coral bleaching is awful to the corals
 they can lose healthiness
 this is important topic of coral bleaching
 
 coral bleaching happens when the coral has no algae or sugar
 then it becomes bleached white
 this can cause death
 it can spread across the coral reef and destroy the coral reef
 it happens at different rates and times
 why
 because when the water temperature increases the carbon dioxide in the water decreases and very little carbon dioxide and it ruins the balance that corals need to be healthy
 then when the coral runs out of it algae and starts to bleach and dies slowly it does not get its nutrients and bleaches
 the rates change because at different times because the water temperature changes and the coral cant produce food or things that the need healthy and alive
 also the wind affects the water and food change since the coral is sensitive on temperatures and cant produce any food
 so thats it thats my answer
 hopefully that answers your question
 
 the coral bleaching at a vary different time because there is enough nutrients for algae to protect the environment
 also coral can survive damages from some destructive thing but the most dangerous threats to coral are those that result in coral bleaching
 coral bleaching refers to an event whereby corals lose their coloring
 during bleaching coral turn white due to the ejection or death of their algae
 this mean that if they dont have enough nutrients or algae they become coral bleaching and it causes to died
 also it cause by the weather
 it change there time
 it may cause thunderstorm or hurricanes
 these are reason that the coral bleaching rates at a vary time
 
 coral bleaching changes at different times
 that is because when they change they are not healthy
 also if they dont change that means they are so healthy
 although if they change they turn all white
 if they dont change they stay all orange
 also when they change it is called bleaching that is when it is white
 the regular name is coral when it is healthy
 the coral bleaching is around the pacific ocean
 like asia australia and north america
 also in the pacific ocean the water is warmer
 and a little less cooler water
 also coral has another important thing it can survive damage from some destructive things
 mostly every time the coral loses their color
 also coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the relationship between the corals and their algae
 that is why coral changes
 
 coral bleaching rate vary at different times
 it happen mostly in the pacific ocean
 coral bleaching happen when it was num
 it happen because the wind change
 the temperatures changes
 coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect relationships with the coral and their algae
 they happen on different times because the wind and water temperature
 because some winds are weak
 and some water temperature is higher
 the coral can survive damage from some destructive
 its bleaching because it does not get carbon dioxide and water to make sugar and release oxygen
 so if it does not have that it turns white
 
 im sure there are many reasons why coral bleaching is caused by things
 there are some people who do it without realizing what they had just done
 but then there are other people who do indispictuous things joyfully and proud that they did it
 i dont think people should be doing this
 this is my opinion for the following
 first of all its wrong because it can harm the entire ecosystem
 if an animal swallows the bleach it can kill them
 second of all it is wrong because the person doing it can go to jail because killing is a crime
 in conclusion they shouldnt bleach random wild life because it is risky
 and it can kill the wild life ecosystem
 
 i think coral bleaching rates vary at different times because of the water temperature
 and the way how that happened was probably because of from how cold or hot it is a times
 i also think that is was because of the weather temperatures that made the corals bleach some of it is just healthy pink coral
 in other words in my opinion i think that some coral are just healthy and pink and other corals can be bleached and look just plain and white instead of pink and healthy
 in the text it shows different graphs for trade winds and coral bleaching
 it also has a map that shows were the coral bleaching has occurred so far
 it has also occurred in the pacific ocean
 in another opinion i think that it might be the trade winds that are causing healthy pink coral to become plain white coral bleach in the pacific ocean
 i saw some pictures of what the coral looked like before when it was healthy and pink
 in the text it said that coral had little tiny animals living in the coral
 in the text it had a picture with arrows and the pacific ocean showing some animals
 for the trade winds it has different colored arrows to show cool and warm waters in the pacific ocean
 i think that if this keeps on going on this might changeour lives might change
 so what i want to know is what will happen next
 
 i think the coral bleaching rates vary at different times because i think that in each ocean the little animals that cause that makes it coral bleaching
 corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyps
 this helped me understand the text because i kept on asking myself what is it made of
 and i think it rates at different times because maybe in some animals there are less coral bleaching
 which may cause less coral bleaching so i think this happens because there might be a lot of coral bleaching in one ocean and a little coral bleaching in another ocean which might cause it to be in rates of different times
 or it might be that in some oceans the water may not have those animals that cause coral bleaching
 i think coral bleaching is like changing one color to white
 every color turns white with bleach but i am not sure about coral bleaching
 i think it is the same just that coral bleaching happens in oceans
 and in one of the graphs in 1998 there was caused a lot of coral bleaching
 and the coral bleaching was at different dates so that is why coral bleaching is caused in different times and what is it made out of
 
 coral bleaching is very different because there are higher waves and week wavers
 for example in the year num there where more weeker waves than higher waves
 upwelling in the eastern pacific causes surface waters to be colder than those in the western pacific
 the reason why i picked this quote was because in the eastern pacific causes the water to be colder than in the western pacific
 a other reason why i picked this quote was because it proves that there are different water wavers
 at the year num was the highest severe coral bleaching
 the bar is up to num or around there
 but that was the highest severe in num we havent had any other severe as num there not up to num
 the average would be around the num to the num but not anything higher than the num
 its still severe but not as the year num
 coral is often mistaken for a rock or plant
 but its really made out of tiny animals called polyps
 the reason why i picked this quote is because it tells you what its made out of
 also because it tells you what they mistake it for
 lastly i say where sunscreen because it could give you skin cancer
 
 coral bleaching changes different times in each year my evidence is on the page num
 it said that during the years this infection happens
 it is called coral bleaching which is a water problem which is a kind of problem that will give you a cause of death when the coral bleaching come during the year
 and because of coral bleaching the water gets colder and hotter
 my evidence is on page num in the little picture with the little arrows that are color red and blue
 red means hot and blue means cold
 i got that also on page num
 
 coral bleaching happens at different times because rain can cause coral bleaching
 its not going to rain on the same day every year
 this drop in salinity threatens the balance necessary to keep the corals healthy 
 this is a good quote because it proved that rain can damage the coral and thats what i said so i proved it
 coral bleaching happens at different times because almost every day there is a different speed of wind
 for example the wind is not going to be the same everyday 
 every few years trade winds change
 that was a good quote because i proved that winds dont stay the same like i said
 coral bleaching happens at different times because of their color
 for example some coral gets damaged quicker then some so some coral will last or live longer
 coral can survive damage from some destructive things
 that a good quote because some can survive damage and some cant like i said so i proved that im correct
 
 there are a few reasons on why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 one of them is because of the winds
 another is because there might be special events
 finally the oceans salinity
 these three things can cause bleaching to vary
 the winds can cause bleaching to vary
 in specific detail the shifting trade winds
 they can cause water temperatures to go up and down
 also depending on the trade the corals will be effected
 also there might be events that take place in the ocean
 anything thats from fishing to explosives
 those items or things can damage coral reefs and can possibly start bleaching
 sometimes they recover though
 finally the oceans salinity
 the salinity can change in shallow oceans
 the coral is sensitive to salinity
 storms and other possible events bring freshwater to the saltwater
 the salinity drops and it effects the coral
 the coral becomes unbalanced and could die
 in conclusions there were a few reasons
 one was because of winds
 another was because of special events in the ocean
 finally storms affect them
 
 cause coral bleaching changes by how many degrees
 and at some years the temperature changes and then some loose there color and so they end up being bleached so they turn white
 then when the wind is moving the water they end up shifting to different areas and thats how they are different at times
 and it happen probably happens in each year
 and some years the temperature gets a little higher than the other years
 
 the rates are a different time by how it goes
 pacific travels east to west
 so it goes to different directions
 every years trade winds changes
 some text evidence is the trade winds weaken or reverse direction completely to blow of west to east
 some more evidence from the text is that the event occurred in num
 it also changes different times by how fast the winds goes and what direction
 another thing is by what direction it goes
 its these animals that live in colonies and tend to stay in one place
 in the east as temperature increases the water swells so its saying if it increases the more bigger the swells get
 coral bleaching rates at different time by how its different water
 its different by how or what direction it goes
 also by how sea level it goes
 thats how coral bleaching is different times
 its really made up of tiny animals called polyps
 these animals live in the ocean
 storms that bring a lot of rainfall like hurricanes or tropical storms
 
 coral bleaching rates a different time because of trade winds
 almost every year trade wind lower their strengths
 coral bleaching is something that cause coral to go plain white
 coral bleaching happens most often in the pacific ocean
 sometiems coral can survive from some destructive thing
 for example they can survive from an underwater mine
 most bombs dont do affect in the water
 but fore some reason fisherman or other people plant these mines in the water
 there was a huge coral bleaching event that happened in num
 it was one of the worst coral bleaching
 
 first coral bleaching can be caused by little tiny animals eating sugar from coral and the coral turns white losing its color it might dye
 second zooxantallae live in coral tissues and need light to make food
 during when doing photosynthesis the algae use energy from sunlight to combine co2 in h2o
 so the coral gets more energy
 third corals are sensitive
 it tells the scientist when the water is too salty
 when storms come it brings a lot of rain
 then they bring fresh water
 the drop salinity threatens the balance necessary to keep corals healthy
 forth zooxanthallae cant live outside of corals body because there is not enough nutrients in the tropical ocean to allow photosynthesis
 fifth coral changes color white when the environment of photosynthesis doesnt agree with coral
 coral will have an disease or starve
 death too
 sixth lastly shifting trade wind makes the sea level by the surface
 it causes major shifts around the waters surface coral
 seventh coral is beautiful in many ways
 
 well coral bleaching is very different it happens time to time
 coral can be severe with coral bleaching
 for example in num the coral had a big rate about num
 coral is actually not plants nor rocks
 its actually made of polyps
 with coral bleaching in the way its a problem to them
 coral bleaching can actually affect them badly
 a lot of stress on corals from the environment may force the coral to eject their food producing algae
 so corals can get affected and comes to a product of coral bleaching
 coral bleaching is very harsh to coral
 it comes time to time when this happens
 for example in the chart coral bleaching wasnt as bad till num that was the problem
 coral bleaching can damage coral very bad
 bleaching makes corals more likely to get a disease or starve
 coral can survive from destructive things but not coral bleaching
 examples of this include fishing using explosives and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs
 but the most harmful thing to coral is coral bleaching
 time to time coral somewhat can still get affected from num and so on
 in num it was probably reaching higher and higher
 people dont leave coral alone coral might not exist no more
 people should help coral in some way
 or to have an area for coral only
 coral can be very different through time
 coral also faces their challenges
 coral can be helped and not be harmed
 people can help coral retrace the color back
 it would be a better thing to do
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because it gets lesser
 coral bleaching rates are really different because they change on a different time also on both they are different graphs
 they change on the year
 one gets by decimal points and one by a line graph
 it changes by one year
 the author shows on the two graphs
 it wins the first graph by guest one year to the other graph
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 how i found in my answer would by showing in the graphs
 i had never seen how or what is coral bleaching
 but yes they do rates vary at different times
 the graph are seen differently on the graphs
 it has the picture different and had seen different to
 also it says that the coral bleaching has stared at num
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 its different because in the beginning it said theres different kind of algae and that gives it its color
 however some coral have lost their color and been bleached a plain white
 that means the aglae helps it gets its color but some have lost there color thats why there called coral bleaching
 coral bleach its in the pacific ocean and it covers one third of it zooxanthallae and coral bleach are almost the same
 coral bleaching has different rates because if weaker trade winds and higher water temps the coral bleaching get a higher rating
 if only the the water temps is high it will have less coral bleaching
 those two things which is trade winds and water temps they both need to be high to get a better rating
 when there both have high rates they have more coral
 
 here i will be explaining why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 i will explaining how coral bleaching happen at different times
 i will be using specific information on why it happens at different times
 one reason was because of weaker trade winds
 in the trade winds and coral bleaching page is a group where theres weaker trade winds more reports happen in the graph beneath
 so this showed me the weaker the trade winds the more coral bleaching
 so coral bleaching happens most when there is weaker trade winds
 another reason for coral bleaching is the high water temperature
 you can see in num the water temp was at its peak so thats why there was so many coral bleaching reports
 so this showed me in higher water temps there is more coral bleaching
 in conclusion i think i learned a lot from this
 the main things that make coral bleaching happen is weaker trade winds and higher water temps
 these were the two things that cause coral bleaching
 
 how coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because of the temperature
 the temperature is supposed to be num degrees fahrenheit
 if it is not the coral could die
 they also need a lot of algae to survive
 if they dont they will bleach
 they die because of the temperature if the sun is not out they die
 also the sun provides heat
 how the coral bleaching rates vary is the fisherman when they come they spill oil and the coral die
 also they drop anchors on the coral
 also if they walk on the reefs
 the coral needs algae to make photosynthesis
 when scuba the boats come by they might hit a reef and explode which damages the reef a lot
 
 coral bleaching happens in different times for many reasons
 to start of a coral gets its color from the algeas sugar
 but when it doesnt get enough sugar it loses color and thats coral bleaching
 this can happen at different rates
 for example the algea needs to go through photosynthesis to get sugar for the corals
 but certain years may not have enough sun light
 for example one year can have a lot of sun light
 that means the algea will make some sugar for the coral reefs
 but other years may not have sun light it could be cloudy all the time
 the algea wont make sugar and the corals wont get its nutrients and will go through coral bleaching
 
 well why coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because that the winds move
 sometimes the winds move to warm surfaces and sometimes to cold surfaces water
 sometimes the water can be colder and sometimes can be warmer or hotter
 some of these corals eat sugars made by algae that live in the coral polyps
 the algae create sugars from sunlight by the process of photosynthesis
 the process requires both carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and release oxygen
 and different types of algae living withen the coral polyps and they give there colors to the corals
 the corals live in the water in the ocean
 some corals can survive at some dangoars destructive things like for example anchors or walking on a reef
 but what kills a coral reef is coral bleaching because coral reefs dont like coral bleaching and it kills them
 so corals dont like coral bleaching
 
 the rates of coral bleaching vary at different times because of the water temperature and trade wind strength
 also how well by the weaker trade winds and higher temperatures
 you see if you read the things i read
 you would understand i got my evidence from the fourth page
 if you where to put it in order like i got it
 it explains how and also why the coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 if you look at the fourth page
 you can see those graphs
 they are explaining the changes in trade winds and the water temperature
 so it sort explains the whole idea
 if you can look closely the lines change
 also everytime the lines change the coral bleaching changes
 so the changing of water temperature and trade wind strengths affects the coral bleaching
 in conclusion the way the trade winds strength and the water temperature changes the coral bleaching when the tradewinds are weak and the water temperatures go up or increase
 
 why and how coral bleaching is different at different times is probably due to the lack of population ill explain and probably because of how cautious people are or where back then
 i got this info because its logical and possible
 some people can be lazy sometimes that can cause coral bleaching going along with cautiousness
 so i will explain my answers to this prompt
 also temperature
 so one of my responses was because of the lack of population
 the reason being is because i had the thought of more fisherman or people that ride over reefs which could kill or damage coral
 i got this because its possible
 more people i think will slightly to increase more fisherman and boats witch could cause coral bleaching
 so this is why i think so
 population can be one of the many causes
 another one is people being non cautious about this situation
 why is because the world is so cruel and many people can harm corals colors without knowing it
 this is harmful to these and we want to preserve
 so this is why
 the text uses fishermen
 and i think fisherman is one cause
 well because this is man and humans are not perfect
 the other reason of temperature is because the water can swell
 as well as shifting trade winds
 so this is sort of killing some coral
 the text states as temperatures increase the water swells
 this is a natural weather cause
 in conclusion these are the reasons why coral bleaching occurs frequent over time
 this is how and why some of the events such as temperature and population
 as well as being cautious
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because coral loses their color and start to bleach
 this is when it is called coral bleaching
 the bleaching is do to the time on how old they are
 the process of bleaching requires both carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and release oxygen also called bleaching
 coral bleaching is when a coral its losing its colors
 the bleaching of a coral it is sad to watch
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because it depends how fast the wind is going
 for example it is fall and strong winds happen
 when its winter  more air and temperatures in water go higher
 it depends in wind and temperature
 wind goes lower water goes higher
 winds go up and water goes down
 
 the way that coral bleaching rates vary at different times is by the way that it has been discovered many different types of corals living in the ocean
 they are vary at different times because in the text it states that the invertebrate animals live together in colonies
 they can vary at different times because of the shifting trade winds too depending how the wind is going and to what direction
 another thing is that in the text it says that coral bleaching is one example of how environmental stresses can negatively affect the relationship between the coral and environment so i think that this is another reason of why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 coral bleaching can vary over different periods of times because there are many different factors that contribute to the bleach
 there can be tempature change accident spilles anchor drops people walking climate change and hot and cold wings
 all of these things can contribute of the murder of thousands of zooxanthallae which is a major organism that helps the coral polups survive
 without them the coral will keep losing its coler and are so thats it its why zooxanthallae is a mahor thing to be kept alive and surviving
 that is why coral bleaching rates differently ever time
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times by many reasons
 one reason is that when theres hurricanes and tropical storms they bring fresh water to salty water and causes the salt levels of the ocean to decrease and the corals need the salt to survive
 another reason it that some destructive practices include blast fishing and tourist droping anchors or walking on reefs cause damage too
 another reason that causes coral bleaching is enviromental stressers can threaten the coral and the zooxanthallae algae
 the algae and the coral need eachother to survive because they use eachothers nutrients to live
 another reason for coral bleaching is the death of the zooxanthellae algae
 those are all the reasons why coral is bleaching
 
 they happen in different times because it all depends on the water
 like the diagram shows the water can have high wind strength or low wind strength
 in num they had the lowest wind strength so not that many corals were infected because of the wind
 when the water tempeture increases the carbon dioxide decreases and because of this the corals start to get threatend because the carbon dioxide helps the coral stay alive and healthy
 corals cant be in salty water because that harms them
 when it rains it helps the coral because the saltyness decreases
 
 the coral bleaching is important in different ways
 for example the coral bleaching affects the pacific ocean
 the ocean covers about one third of the surface of the entire globe and contains double the amount of water found in the atlantic ocean
 the different types of algae living within the coral polyps give the corals their varying colors
 some coral have been bleached a plain white
 of course the coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses it color
 but even events leading to coral bleaching are an a series problem with a serious impact on the worlds coral reefs
 of course coral is often mistaken for a rock or plant
 but a coral polyp has a saclike body and a mouth surrounded by stinging tentacles
 but coral polyps range of the in size from tiny to up to a foot in diameter
 corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyps
 polyps use limestone from seawater to build a hard skeleton
 this hard skeleton protects the delicate body of the polyp
 but some of the corals reefs are only found in a clear shallow tropical waters
 but it was because algae called zooanthellae that live in a coral tissues and need light for photosynthesis
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because it depends where the coral reefs live at
 every few years winds are altered
 this causes the trade winds to weaken or completely change direction
 also because in order for corals to live they must be in a water temperatures between num fahrenheit
 however when surface water shifts eastward ocean waters temperature can increase by num fahrenheit and in some places the water temperature can increase over num fahrenheit above the customary range
 this is not healthy because if the water temperature increases too much the corals might be in danger
 another reason why coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature
 if the water temperature increases the solubility of carbon dioxide in water decreases
 the decrease in carbon dioxide disrupts the process of photosynthesis and this will not keep the corals healthy
 finally coral bleaching rates can happen at different times depending on the zooxanthellae
 the zooxanthellae has a symbiotic relationship with the corals so they both benefit from eachother
 if the zooxanthallae dies the corals will bleach and turn white
 increased stress on the corals from the environment like blast fishing tourists who drop anchors can cause the coral to eject the zooxanthallae and then the corals will bleach and make the corals diseased
 if the coral goes for too long without zooxanthallae bleaching can result in death
 coral bleaching can happen at different times because the wind and temperature can affect it also the food they eat like zooxantheallae
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because in the text it states that every few years trade winds are altered
 they weaken or reverse direction
 under these circumstances warm surface waters travel eastwards
 this movement causes the central  eastern pacific regions to warm up
 on the graph it shows that when the wind weakens the temperature rises
 on the other graph it shows that when the wind weakend and the temperature rose the number of countries reporting coral bleaching was high
 reef building coral need water temperature between num fahrenheit
 when temperature increases it threatens the health of coral reefs salinity also threatens their health
 this happens during storms
 these are reasons how and why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times due to the weather
 also due to the tourist that go
 so coral bleaching isnt always the same its different because of the food that they need and they dont get which is what makes it different
 also due to what is making the coral bleach that is how much the rate will change and wont be the same
 to start of there are rates that vary due to the weather
 since it says that reefbuilding corals need water temperatures between num fahrenheit
 photosynthesis is sensitive to change in water temperature
 this affects the coral since it feeds off from sugar and the sugar creates algae from the light the sun gives which is the process of photosynthesis
 this is are the way coral rates vary
 when storms drop fresh water into the ocean the salinity drops
 this drop in salinity threatens the balance necessary to keep corals healthy
 another way that explains why coral bleaching rates vary at different times is due to the tourists that go on oceans
 corals can sustain physical damage from some destructive practices
 examples of this include blast fishing and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs
 this affects reefs because they are being steped on
 who knows maybe they can get damaged due to this
 but also since the coral reefs can get stuck on anchors or can get droped off
 however there is also another thing that shows why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 this is due to the fact that whereby corals are loosing their coloring
 also due to the increasing stress on corals from the environment force to the coral to ejet their foodproducing algae
 this result in a bleaching event that makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation
 also if the coral goes to long without zooxanthallae bleaching can result to dead
 this is how coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 coral bleaching happens when the coral doesnt get the right amount of food or nutrients needed to live
 the corals need zooxanthallae to live and by the years pass the amount of zooxanthallae decreases wich makes the coral bleach
 another reason why coral bleaching occurs would be because of the water tempetures around the world
 the water is already warm because the wind has moved it to different spots then the sun warms the water wich makes it hard to make photosinthesis or food for the corals
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because of the wind
 on the graphs shown to me i found a pattern wich was the higher the water tempeture the lower the wind strenght and the lower the wind strenght the higher the water tempeture
 on my graph i also found that in the year num the wind strength was really wear and it had a high amount of water tempeture
 i also noticed on my second graph that in the year num the severe number of coral bleaching was higher than num
 the usual colors of corals are bright like orange yellow blue green many other variaty of colors that come from corals in my opinion white should not be one of those colors
 all around the pacific ocean close to north america and asia and papua new guinea there has been alot of colral bleaching
 this might be because of the human activity around the with the fishing and fisherman hurting the corals
 coral bleaching also means that the corals are dying not good
 those are some reasons coral bleaching happen and the more reasons why we should preserve corals
 
 i think that coral bleaching rates change at different times because of mainly three reasons
 in the article about the background it stated that one of the big factors on the bleaching of corals is because the change in the wind
 another factor that is stated is the temperature of the ocean
 finally i think that the rates change by ocean currents
 the change in the wind is a big factor on coral bleaching rates when the wind blows in a certain direction that affects the temperature
 the wind that is being blown in a direction can be either cold or warm changing the temperature
 when the temperature is change is affects the zooxanthellae process of phonosinthisis which give the coral color
 it all dipends when the direction of the wind changes
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because every few years the trade winds change direction going opposite and some last over about six months
 this causes major shifts in the worlds climate
 also the graph of this shows how mostly every five years the water temps get higher the same report for the coral bleaching it gets severe each five years
 coral bleaching also vary at different times because when water temperatures increase the solubility of carbon dioxide decrease and whent carbon dioxide decreases this disruption threatens the delicate balance required to keep corals healthy
 also when storms drop fresh water in the ocean the salinity drops and the salinity threatens the balance necessary to keep the corals healthy
 of the corals do not get zooxanthellae that passes food they make from the suns energy to the coral the coral can die causing bleaching death to it
 this is how and why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 this were the reason why and how coral bleaching occurs
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because when the temp increases the carbon dioxide decreases and creates a distruption that threatens the balence to keep the corals healthy
 when storms like excessive rain fall or hurricanes drops cold water and threatens the corals health because the salinity drops
 the temperature takes a big part on the corals health because the water cant be so cold otherwise it loses its salinity which corals need
 corals must be in clear water because they have to go thru photosynthesis
 the water has to be warm around num fahrenheit
 
 coral bleaching vary because i guess sometimes they just dont get the right temperature
 the warm water movement happens on the water eastward and causes climate changes shifting trade winds
 i can support this evidence with the two graphs trade winds and coral bleaching looking on the year num
 not having the right temperature this is because the process of photosynthesis needs a required temperature to happen and because corals or polyps eat from it too 
 the saltiness of the water also effects the corals
 the whole coral bleeching is about the changes in the temperature and ocean
 
 coral bleaching varies because due to tempeture
 around the west side the water is really cold and around the equatorial and north its hot
 sometimes it shifts direction so that causes coral bleaching due to the tempeture in water the drastic happened in num
 it was terriable
 also coral belching is linked to marine life
 corals are living things
 
 coral bleaching is important to me because it shows how much i understand it if rates to vary at different time when i used to think coral bleaching level to involve the ocean
 does coral bleaching kill animals at any times
 does it still have to involve the ocean at any common sense were does it involve it
 this reminds me of bleaching the sea sort of to me
 
 every year the rates of coral bleaching rising every year lowers than gets higher
 but they become really severe every year
 they rise and the corals color turn white because they need algae and  zooxanthalle to live with out it they would lose color and die
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because corals need water temperatores between num fahrenheit
 this partly because photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature
 as water temperature increases the solubility of carbon dioxide co2 in water decreases
 the decrease in carbon dioxide co2 disrupts photosynthesis
 of that it ruins the balance that corals make the coral turn white which is called coral bleaching
 
 coral bleaching happens because the polyps go on the coral and they have different colors
 then the bleach this plain white color gos on it and makes it white so if the coral is red they that bleach comes and then the coral is white that is bad
 because the fish can die of bleach and the polyps die too
 the salinity helps the coral because that what they need to survive
 so if the coral is stressed by the environment it may not produce the food from algae and thats how they are bleached
 the worst coral bleaching was in num
 the coral bleaching i think it efects the fish too because they dont want to live in white coral they can die maybe
 the coral dies die the algae dies and ejection can happen
 that is what might be coral bleaching and different rates vary at different times
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because of the environment
 if a coral is living in an area where there temperature is hotter or colder than num to num fahrenheit then there is a chance that the coral can die causing the color of the coral to turn to white
 also if people who are living in a place near the ocean where corals live that can be the problem
 some people through garbages and many other things in the sea and that can really kill a coral because they arent healthy
 environmental stressors can affect the relationship between the corals and their algae
 the sentence is saying that if the coral feels a lot of pressure it can lead to coral bleaching so if the coral is in an are where there arent a lot of pressure then it
 in the text it says a lot of stress on corals from the environment may force the corals to eject their foodproducing algae
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because i think that every time they bleach means that they need more food
 or maybe they bleach cause there getting sick
 
 the rate is different because maybe there was only a little coral in the num thats why there wasnt a lot coral bleaching
 then in the num there were more corals so the coral bleaching was severe
 finally in num the coral bleaching went down again
 the information i wrote down was from the graph page of the document
 
 i think coral bleaching rates vary some different times because of the shifting winds move around the algea in the ocean making it hit certain areas in the ocean that have a lot of coral
 but
 
 coral bleaching rates at different times because of how healthy its supposed to be
 it really depends on what the coral is doing eating and things like that
 it said on the text that events leading to coral bleaching are serious problem with a serious impact on the worlds coral reefs
 i agree with that thats maybe a way coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 wind ocean currents and temperatures can also be the problem
 movement of warm water eastward causes major shifts in the worlds climate
 due to that coral can have an effect on it
 looking at a graph of coral bleaching most of the time it was severe
 in num there were num countries that had coral bleaching
 i think this happen because of the weather in the countries
 
 the coral bleaching this is how the get ther color is by the different types of algae living within the coral
 some of them lost there color  bean bleach a plane white that is why it is called coral bleaching
 
 coral bleaching comes from people doing stuff to the oceans
 by them doing that they are killing the corals and i think are only found in shallow waters clear and tropical water
 carbon is passed from algae to the coral in the form of sugars
 in addition to clear shallow water reefbuilding corals need water temperatures between num fahrenheit
 the corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity
 i think that coral bleaching is good and bad because i dont know what coral belching is so im just going to go with and know
 
 coral bleaching rates vary because of the changes in weather their environment and because of the algae
 these changes make a huge impact on coral reefs because they are very sensitive to ocean salinity and changes in water temperature
 the changes in weather impact coral reefs because of their sensitivity to water temperature
 the temperature needs to be about num fahrenheit in order for them to feel camfortable
 their environment needs to be clear water that is shallow and tropical because algae that lives in the coral tissue needs light to make food
 the algae uses energy from the sunlight to create sugars and oxygen which is a mix between carbon dioxide and water
 if the coral loses its color coral bleaching then the algae will die then the coral will die
 the coral bleaching varies because of changes in weather their environment and the algae that live inside the coral
 
 most coral reefs need food to survive so they live in shallow clear tropical waters
 hey live there because the water is clear so the sun hits the water to make algae
 there are many places to have clear water
 if corals dont have algae then they die and turn white
 coral bleaching
 the corals are just like us humans because they need food to survive
 coral bleaching is a problem between corals and algae
 corals can still live if they dont have algae but they can get a disease and that could effect the other animals in the water
 in some places the sun is blocked because the trees or the water is to dark
 some coral reefs can live in the dark waters but they wont get any algae and they could die or get a disease
 thats why corals in the clear shallow tropical water to get the algae
 the reason why they rate vary at different time is because algae only like the sun
 say i live in california and there are coral since the weather is so warm in california the algae leaves because it is very warm
 the reason its very warm is because they we use carbon dioxide
 like burning fossile fuels thats what causes algae to leave so the coral becomes bleached
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because if the water was hot then it would bleach more corals underwater than cold weather
 according to the text coral bleaching happends more often on the pacific ocean
 what is also on the text that supports my essay is coral is often mistaken for a rock or a plant but it is really made up of tiny animals called polypus
 and that helps with people who dont know what corals are made up of
 since coral reef can only eat little particals in water and with corals that are infected with bleach if they no longer eat the little particles or whatever they eat they will die
 since coral reefs can take damage such as in the text fishing with explosions and tourists who drop anchors or walk on reefs
 
 what i have learned from this is that coral bleaching is bad for the environment and coral reefs
 due to coral bleaching many things get harmed not just the coral
 for example the algae the zooxanthellae also get harmed
 what is coral
 coral is not a plant but a living animal
 but due to coral bleaching is dieing out
 coral bleaching mainly happens in the pacific ocean
 coral can be mistaken for a rock or plant but it isnt it is made up of little animals called polyps
 a polyps has a little body with tenticles
 coral bleaching happens when a lot of stress is on the coral this makes the coral eject the food producing algae
 that is what causes coral bleaching
 in num there was a big coral bleaching event it kill almost sixteen percent of the worlds coral reefs
 
 because since corals are animals and not plants or rocks this basically affects the environment
 why
 mainly because corals are human beings which means that we should let them live
 plus is can affect out environment by sending the water temperature to rise and also send more waves to the west well im pretty sure it stated that in the text because it literally did on about the second page 1 even seen it perhaps the picture represented that to me
 well i know that its bad for coral bleaching it can some what affect the environment
 for example the corals die if they get stressed too much in the environment then they will let out their food processing food which is bad for this environment
 and it also really shouldnt happen at all
 
 coral bleaching is when corals lose their color
 most of the coral bleaching happens in the pacific ocean in the pacific ocean covers one third of the surface of the world
 the pacific ocean is filled with fresh water
 coral reefs can also survive in water that has salinity meaning salt water
 in the text i read that carbon dioxide or known as co2 is what is causing the corals to bleach their colors
 as the temperature swells the water the sea levels are rising
 in the year of num coral reefs bleached the most and very severely
 did you know that an animal can make their own food
 that falls in to the topic of photosynthesis
 photosynthesis is a very cool topic in science i always wonder how does an animal do such a thing
 a fun fact is did you know a coral reef animal is about two millimeters long
 
 it rates at very different times because coral is a type of thing underwater
 its called algae a type of plant under water
 first when it grows its healthy and then once it gets older it get old and then bleaches off
 if that happens fishes and other animals who eat that will not have it anymore if it dies
 humans like us cant really do anything about it
 sure can the creatures underwater coral bleaching rates at vary different times because it maters or when the plant is growen and also how healthy it is
 for that it rates at different times
 coral bleaching can happen at anytime and plants and fishes can have problems for food and shelter
 coral bleaching is also has connection with the wind and what direction the wind goes too
 like for an example if the coral bleaching goes to the east and then west theres always a difference
 mostly coral bleaching is found in oceans like pacific ocean that takes up one third of land so there more coral bleaching but a lot know ones grow
 another one is atlantic ocean and probably there more oceans like this
 
 cause people are more cautions about coral but sometimes thereyve not caution of the coral reef that why the table went down cause people where catians of the coral reef getting damaged
 
 there are many ways why and how coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 first one reason why coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because according to the graphs in the year num the number of countries reporting coral bleaching was very severe
 the number was around num
 according to the graph above it that graph show water temperature versus trade winds
 in that graph that show water temperature versus trade winds it show that in the year num there were weaker trade winds and higher water temperature
 this is one of the many reasons why and how coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 when merine bologist have found many tips of corals wirming in oceans
 most corals eat sugars made by algee that lives in coral polyps algee creates sugar from sunlight by processes of photosynthesis is carbon dioxide and water make sugar and rease oxygen
 and coral bleaching are a serious problem with serious  impact on the worlds coral reefs
 do you know that coral reefs live in colanise that are made up of many ployps
 
 coral bleaching is when the coral under the ocean turns white thats called coral bleacing the process has to have both carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and release oxigon
 coral bleaching happens most often in the pacific ocean and containg doble the amount of water than the atlantic ocean
 coral bleaching reasearchers studie climate change and coral
 
 they vary at different times in rates because of different water temparatures
 like because they survive on algae and algae survive on sunlight
  so if there is no sunlight the algae wont survive if they dont get sunlight the algae are going to die
 so the corals wont have enough the coral bleaching
 so the rates will vary at different times
 
 coral reefs that bleach means they dont have that much food or carbon dioxide
 without the carbon dioxide and water the coral reefs wont grow at all
 they also need light to have food for other algaes
 there are different rate times because of the weather or light in the area
 also they dont have a lot of carbon dioxide to make them grow or feed the algeas
 also another thing is the weaker the trade winds the more the coral reefs bleach
 mostly it happens in the pacific ocean and cover one third of the water in earth
 with the weak winds the water tempenture will go higher and burn the coral reefs a lot more thats why there were a lot bleached at num
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times due to the shifting trade winds
 the trade winds weaken or revrse direction completely to  from west to east
 it also depends of the lack of zooxantelle there is
 it provides the coral ne to provide it to be able to survive
 also the decrease of carbon dioxide also can effect it which can start causing bleaching and make it become unhealthy without photosynthesis the corals can start bleaching and the lack at some soft to cause it trade winds is also    because it can start to weaken or get higher
 it can cause a lot of shifts towords the worlds climate
 
 coral bleaching rates can happen at any time
 sometimes the coral may start to bleach due to the winds and which direction theyre moving to
 when the deeper colder waters rise to the surface thats called upwelling
 the winds may cause some change to the coral just by blowing east or west
 this works and actually does some changes because the text states when surface waters shift eastward ocean water temperatures increase by num fahrenheit to num fahrenheit
 the wind is not the only thing that may change the coral the temperature is an impact as well
 in the east as temperatures increase the water swells
 this usually happens most of the time along equatorial regions
 a lot of people mistake coral for a type of rock or plant
 coral is actually made up of a bunch of tiny animals called polyps
 coral reefs are only found in clear shallow tropical waters
 
 marine biologist have discovered many different types of living corals in the ocean
 these invertebrate animals live together in colonies and lead to stay in one place
 the different types of algae living within the coral polyps give the coral their varying colors
 some coral have been bleached a plain white
 coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color
 coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean
 pacific waters along the coastal regions have changes in wind ocean currents and temperatures and these variations are linked to marine life
 corals live in colonies of many polyps polyps use limestone from sea water to build a hard skeleton which helps protect the delicate body of the polyp
 corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity
 salinity can change in shallow coastal regions during storms drop fresh water into the ocean the salinity drops
 this drop in silinity threatens the balance necessary to keep the corals healthy
 storms
 when these storms drop fresh water into the ocean the salinity drops
 the drop in salinity threatens the balance necessary to keep the corals
 the most dangerous treats to coral bleaching
 coral bleaching refers to an event where corals lose their color
 corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooxanthllae
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 the rate vary due to changes in wind ocean currents and temperatures
 this variations can be more drasticaly different than normal
 as stated in the document this was the case in one event that occurred in num
 the wind drag were surface waters westwards this causes waters in the west to increase in temperature
 meanwhile the deeper colder waters in the eastern pacific rise to the surface this causes the waters in the east to be colder
 the coral reefs live in water temperatures num fahrenheit in order to balance the process of photosynthesis for zooxanthellae who provide the corals with fifty percent to ninetyfive percent of their energy
 the change of wind vary through out the years
 when the trade winds are altered the temperature of the waters in east will increase in the waters in the west will decrease
 this change of water temperature affects the corals because the corals cannot move they will have to face the increase of water temperature
 increase in water temperature disrupts the balance of the photo
 
 the reason why coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because the fisherman who work with the pacific waters along the coastal regions of south america know that for many centuries there has been changes in wind ocean currents and temperatures
 so that means that some variations are more drastic than normal
 it all really depends on the temperature the coral reefs are in which actually there are various reasons why coral bleaching occurrs in the first place
 but anywho different corals come in many colors so some might get better nutrients then others and what not and some might lose its color due to the environment or treatment it gets
 thats why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 coral rates bleaching rates vary at different times
 different types of algae give the corals their colors
 some corals however lose their color and get bleached into a white
 the coral bleaching occurs due to the increase of stress on corals from the environment
 in which bleaching can result to death
 for example the huge coral bleaching that occurred in num that caused the death of sixteen percent of the worlds coral reefs
 changes in wind ocean currents and temperatures and linked to coral bleaching
  the shifting trade winds change the temperature of the water
 the weaker the tradewinds the higher the water temperatures
 for reefbuilding corals water temperature need to be between num fahrenheit
 the changes in water temperature affect the process of photosynthesis
 carbon dioxide is needed for the corals to stay healthy so the higher the water temperature the solubility of carbon dioxide decreases in which creates a disruption in the process of photosynthesis
 the disruption threatens the healthy corals
 
 coral bleaching occurs in many diffrent times
 they can be healthies when coral feeds off of sugars made by algae
 coral bleaching can happen when people drop anchors
 also coral bleaching can happen either ejection or death of the zooxanthellae
 if the coral goes for too long without zooxanthellae bleaching can result in death
 stated in the article coral and zooxanthallae
 the coral provides a protected nutrient rich environment for the alge
 based on own space corral bleaching basically when corals lose their coloring
 another reason why coral bleaching happens would be when corals have stress from the environment three forces the coral to eject their foodproducing alage in which results in a bleaching event that makes coals vulnerable to disease and starvation
 
 coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color
 there are many events that can lead to coral bleaching
 one of them which is possibly the greatest factor is the temperature of the water
 water temperature in pacific ocean where the worst case of coral bleaching ocurred can change drastically
 the change in water temperature is known as upwelling
 upwelling is when the wind drags warm surface water westward and the cooler water in the eastern pacific else to the surface
 however the winds that drag the water are often altered making them weaker  or reverse direction completely to blow from west to east
 this causes the central and eastern pacific regions to warm
 according to the article trade winds and coral bleaching in num the tradewinds in the pacific became weaker by nearly ten meters per second causing the temperature of the water to rise about num degrees faranheit
 in that same year over num countries reported coral bleaching around the pacific ocean
 however water temperature does not cause coral bleaching directly zooxanthallae or algae are contributors to a corals color
 algea live in the coral tissues and need light for photosynthesis
 this process provides the coral with carbon in the farm of glycerol or glucose
 these chemicals provide corals with the energy they need to survive
 when the water temperature rises algae stops providing corals with glucose
 therefore the coral cant support a lot of algae so its forced to expell  algae
 this causes a coral to become weak and unhealthy and is also loses its color
 this makes corals vulnerable to disease and starvation
 if it goes for too long without algae bleaching can result in the death of the coral
 
 marine biologist have discovered different types of corals in the ocean
 some corals gain color some loses color
 corals arent plants their animals
 most corals are feed sugar by algae that live in corals polyps
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times maybe because of the weather
 coral bleaching is an example of how environmental stressors can negatively affect the relationship between the coral and zooxanthallae
 coals can also sustain physical damage from some destructive practices such as blast fishing or tourists with anchors
 coral bleaching refers to an event whereby corals turn white due to the ejection or death of the zooanthallae algae
 corals are also sensitive to ocean salinity to see how salty the water is
 salinity can change in shallow coastal regions during storms that bring excessive rainfall hurricanes or even tropical storms
 the different types of algae living within the coral polyps give the corals their varying colors
 some coral have been bleached a plain white
 coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which coral loses its color events leading to coral bleaching are a serious problem with a serious impact on the worlds coral reefs
 coral bleaching is most noticeable in the pacific ocean
 coral reefs are only most noticeable in the pacific ocean
 coral reefs are only found in clear shallow tropical waters
 a coral poylp has a saclike body and a mouth surrounded by stinging tentacles
 corals live in colonies that are made up of many polyp
 reefbuilding corals need water temperatures between num fahrenheit because the process of photosynthesis is sensitive to changes in water temperature
 
 water temps is low weaker trade winds in num
 coral bleaching in per year is num in num
 these animals live in colonies and tend to stay in one place
 and most coral eat sugars made by algae
 these algae create sugars from sunlight by the process of photosynthesis
 the process requires both carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and release oxygen
 the different types of algae living within the coral polyps give the corals their colors
 however some coral have lost their color and been bleached a plain white
 this is called coral bleaching and coral bleaching happens most in the pacific ocean
 this ocean covers about num of the surface of the entire globe and contains double the amount of water found in the atlantic ocean
 fisherman have worked along the pacific coastal regions of south america for centuries
 they have known about changes in wind life
 at times these variations are more drastic than normal
 this was the case in an event that occurred in num
 
 coral bleaching means different types of algae living in polyps that had been bleached in white plain and lost there colors is called coral bleaching
 this coral bleaching causes a serious problem with a serious impact on the world that affect the coral reefs
 this coral bleaching are happens most in the pacific ocean and this ocean covers about num surface of globe and they double amount of water found in the atlantic ocean
 this was case in an event that occurred in num
 there are shifting trade winds that travels from east to west
 many time deeper colder waters in the eastern pacific rise to the surface is known as upwelling
 this upwelling cause surface water to be colder than those in the western pacific
 in this region the normal water temperature is num degrees fahrenheit
 when the surface water shift eastward the temperature increases num degrees fahrenheit
 coral and photosynthesis
 the coral is often mistaken for a rock or plant
 they are made up of tiny animals called polyps
 they are found in clear shallow tropical water partly called zooxanthellae
 during they make the food the algae use energy from carbon dioxide co2 in the ocean with h20
 in the clear shallow water reef building coral need water temperatures between num degrees fahrenheit
 coral and zooxanthellae have a symbiotic relationship
 in fact zooxanthellae cannot live without the outside of corals body
 there was large coral bleaching even in num
 it was the worst ever observed
 this result in sixteen percent of the death of the worlds coral reefs
 
 coral bleaching coral is something that lives in the ocean can be in different colors
 sometimes it loses color and turns white
 events that lead to coral bleaching are a serious problem with serious impact
 coral bleaching happens most often in pacific ocean
 it covers about one third of the surface on the entire globe
 when the water temperature decrease the coral will increase and when the water temperature increase the coral will decrease
 environmental stressors can negatively affect the relationship between the corals and their algae
 a lot of stress on corals from the environment many force the coral to eject their food producing algae
 this results in bleaching
 bleaching makes corals to get a disease or starve if the coral goes for too long without their algae bleaching can result in death
 there was a coral bleaching even that happened in num
 when they observed it it was the worst sixteen percent of corals died that time
 so when the water temperature decrease the corals increase and when the water temperature increase the corals decrease
 
 coral bleaching is really  for coral because it can kill them
 coral bleaching turns the coral white and its natural color is pink
 coral benefits from zooxanthelle because it gives the coral food
 coral bleaching varys in different times because when theirs no food or sunlight to coral start to become bleached coral
 the coral needs the exact temperature to start doing the process of photosynthesis
 if the water temperature changes either to high or to low the coral want to be able to be doing the process of photosynthesis
 the coral needs to also get sunlight for this process
 coral bleaching can occur if the water temperature are to high or low so it can depend on theirs
 once the coral is bleached it can get a disease and die
 coral bleaching rates in different times because different events can happen
 what also causes coral bleaching is salinity
 the coral doesnt need that much salt in water
 the natural disasters can make the water move so if theirs a body of water with alot of salt it can affect the coral health
 theirs no way to stop coral bleaching so thats when it depends because coral bleaching  occurr anytime its missing a source or its a    a bad source to its health
 the coral in 1998 alot of  it died because of coral bleaching
 the most deaths of coral is because as you can see in the graph not all the years your going to get the same number of deaths
 the  changes in years because the bleached coral varied different times
 coral bleaching can occur any moment its missing something
 it varies different times because the coral
 
 how coral are bleaching because the water temperature is increasing the solubility of carbon dioxide co2 in water decreases
 also the water decrease in carbon dioxide co2 disrupts photosynthesis
 this can change and ruin the ballance that corals need in order to be healthy in order to live most of the time
 why coral has been bleaching because a lot of stress of the coral will make the oral eject their foodproducing algae
 also when tourist drop anchors or walk on reefs also heart the coral
 
 coral bleaching change at different times because every year between num  it increasing or it was decreasing
 i know how coral bleaching rates vary at different times because coral bleaching changes very often like every year because   it the focus on on the trade winds so if the trade winds get very hight coral bleaching is going to hight as well
 i want to know do we need coral bleaching what do it help us do what do it help in the oceans
 
 these animals live in colonies and tend to stay in one place
 these algae create surgars from sunlight by the process of photosynthesis
 some coral have lost their color and been bleached a plain white
 this ocean covers about one third of the surface of the entire globe
 they have known about changes in wind ocean currents and temperatures
 and how these variations are linked to marine life
 this was the case in an event that occurred in num
 pacific tade wind travel from east o west
 at the same time the deeper colder wathers in the eastern pacific rises to the surface
 
 coral bleaching the time when the wind blow really hard it also bleach
 when other polyps rap around it and when it has storms the zooxanthellae pulls up and when it get higher it bleaches it self when storms come if it was a tornadow the water will continue swirling up in circles and zooxanthellas come up when it only comes and hits the zoozanthellas
 zooanthellas turn sometime purple white or maybe yellowish it get desese or starve some destructive things when ther not in the right places
 in num it went up a lot away to num coaral bleaching in num the wind got weaker and weaker a lot by day marine biologists have form many types of coals years ago in living oceans some of them stay in one place when wind blows
 they are in pacific oceans  some are stuck together and some are not atlantic oceans have many of the them they have them in different areas
 coaral bleaching is most often in the pacific  ocean fisher man worked along the pacific coastal regions of south america for centuries
 they have known about canges in wind ocean currents variations are linked to marine life
 this was the case in event that occurred in num
 
 from reading the documents given i now know that coral bleaching rates vary at different times because corals need the right water temperature and the right amount of salinity
 drop on salinity or the decreasing and increasing of water temperature threatens the balance necessary to keep them healthy it varies because sometimes temperatures can be high and others low
 salinity balances   are decreasing when it storms but there asnt a storm everyday so the salinity balance only decreases at certain times
 i also know that coral bleaching as when coral loses color
 i can infer that there has to be something in coral or on coral that gaves it its color
 i found in the text that zooanthellae algae benfit from their relationship with each other
 coral provides a protected environment food or nutrients for the algae
 the zooanthellae algae passes some of the food of the coral and the algae also helps with its colors
 so if algae helps corals with their colors the algae would have to be removed from the environment or killed then coral would lose its color
 due to death of algae corals lose their color and become bleached
 i now know what causes coral bleaching
 
 coral bleaching rates at different times because they
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because of the different types of algae living within the coral polyps
 also because at times these variations are more drastic than normal
 and cause these animals live in colonies and tend to stay in one place
 most coral eat sugars made by algae that live in the corals polyps like other plant life these algae create sugars from sunlight by the process of photosynthesis the process requires both carbon dioxide and water to make sugars and release oxygen
 also i think that num was a very dangerous year for coral reef
 thats how and why coral bleaching rates vary at different times
 
 coral bleaching happens at different times because a lot of stress on the coral from the environment may force the coral to eject their foodproducing algae
 and this results is bleaching
 this is the way coral bleaching happens at different times
 coral bleaching often happens in the pacific ocean it says in the text i think this happens because when people throw things in the water it might taver to the pacific ocean and when it do it might hurt the coral dont get to eat the algae the fish gives
 
 according to the articles coral bleaching is affected by several things
 in the reading background what is coral bleaching it states changes in wind ocean currents and temperatures and how these variations are linked to marine life
 from this quote you can infer that there are possible causes for coral bleaching
 later on in the graphs water temperature versus trade winds and coral bleaching reports per year you can tell there is a connection between the change in water temperature and cases reported where countries reported coral bleaching in num
 after reading the remaining articles i believe that with the change in weather patterns causes the rates of coral bleaching
 if one increases salinity and raising water temperature increases coral bleaching also rises
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because sometimes they dont have what they need to stay alive
 the algae creats sugar
 that sugar is like foodenergy to the corals
 if they dont have algae they loose there color
 if they dont have for a long time they might even die
 they can survive explosives or tourists who drop anchors or walks on reefs
 but when they get coral bleaching they need algae so that they can survive
 if they dont they die
 in 1998 there was coral bleaching and 16 of the worlds coral reefs died
 i think it was because they did have enough of the algae sugar to eat
 
 it happens because they see little organisms that are moving and so what they do is take out the organisms that move and they take the plant and the bleach it to look half colored and half white to make it a healthy plant
 so then they just find a spot that is empty and they put it back into the ocean and if anymore plants are like that then they do more stuff
 first they examine it and then they bleach it more and more so once all the corals are bleached you can put them back in the ocean so once you did that you can look for more and bleach them all whole thing again and it is hard for a plant to do that
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because some of the coral is severed because some of the bleaching gives a disease to the coral and the rates vary on how much bleaching there is but some of the coral survives
 this happens because of ejection or death of their algae and they lose their coloring
 
 i think coral bleaching is different at times because of wind strength
 well thats one reason
 when the wind is stronger the water is colder
 i know that has something to do with the coral bleaching
 for example when the wind strength is lower the temperature of the water goes higher
 like num the wind was at num and the water was colder
 in this same year there was severe bleaching in many countries
 
 the reason coral bleaching rates vary at different times is because of the water temperatures the winds bring when they change
 because corals need a certain temperature of water to stay healthy when it changes drastically it can screw up everything and then they die
 another factor to the bleaching is the amount of salt in the water
 when large rain storms drop a bunch of clean low salted water they can be affected because they need a good amount of salt to keep doing their job
 when the algae in the coral dies then the color drains out because the algae is dead
 so its a big chain reaction
 rain and temperature shifts then less healthy coral then the coral dies and doesnt make oxygen and then all the local fish die because they cant breathe
 
 coral bleaching happens when the algae living in the corals die
 when they die the coral turns to a plain white color
 there are many reasons why the algae might die
 if the water temperature increases it could damage the algae because when the temperature increases the carbon dioxide decreases
 the algae need the carbon dioxide to produce food
 when they produce food it gives some to the coral
 the algae is also very sensitive to the water salinity
 when the storms drop fresh water into the oceans salt water the salinity drops
 when the salinity drops it is a major threat to the algae
 
 coral bleaching is happening everywhere
 when the ocean is getting bleached not only does it clean it but it mostly harms it and the marine life is getting hurt to
 corals are not plants they are actually animals
 how you when a coral is getting harmed by looking at the color a seeing that its turning white
 it looses its beautiful colors
 in the first chart called water temperature versus trade winds you can see that in the year of 1998 the water temperature is really high and there is weaker trade winds
 the year num was also the year when there was a major bleaching event
 sixteen percent of the worlds coral reefs had died
 by all this evidence you can probably tell the pattern of why the rates are different at different times
 it all depends on the wind and water temperature
 the second chart on coral bleaching reports per year also helps us notice a trend of the bleaching rates
 since all the chart graphing data goes together you can also tell the pattern
 all the other years except for the year num are having the rates around 30 below
 that is why people need ot be more careful with the ocean
 we are killing animals coral are animals because they have animal cells
 we need their beautiful color to come back and live
 
 i couldnt really understand the text but i understand some of it
 back in num the wind trades were really weak and water was warm
 the coral bleaching was the severest year of all
 
 coral bleaching rates very at different times because it was proscess good and bad at different times
 sometimes it might work a little or it might not work
 many coral bleaching is found in some oceans
 sometime if its to much of the coral bleach in the ocean then it might can kill lots of plants
 also lots of swimming pools have coral bleach in it as well
 in order for it to be strong you have to treat it
 pacific trade winds travel from east to west
 the highest was num
 though all the years its been going up and down
 but why would they stop in num
 this was the in an event that occurred in num
 events that lead to coral bleaching are a serious problem with a serious impact on the worlds cora reefs
 
 coral bleaching rates vary at different times because the change of wind ocean currents and temperatures
 in the text it said some coral have lost their color and been bleached a plain white
 in the text it said that in num that it was the most color bleaching
 he years that had the least color bleaching was num num and num
 the pacific ocean have the most coral bleaching
 when these storms drop fresh water into the ocen the salinity drops
 this drop in salinity threatens the balance necessary to keep the coral healthy
 there was a large coral bleaching event in num
 it was one of the worst ever observed
 this event resulted in the death of sixteen percent of the worlds coral reefs
 a lot of stress on coral from the environment may face the coral to eject their foodproducing algae
 this results in bleaching
 bleaching makes coral more likely to get a disese or starve
 if the coral goes for too long without their algae bleaching can result in death
 
 coral bleaching rates vary as the trade winds vary
 on the map showing the location of coral affected most we can see that the largest affected area was on the coast of south america
 then if you look at the map showing the warm and cold currents once the trade winds arrive you have to take notice of the area by the coast of south america
 the trade winds are causing colder water to go into the coral area
 since  the coral need relatively high temperatures to survive this is killing them off
 the strength of the trade winds varies as well so sometimes the new cold currents arent as cold
 this means that a different amount of corals are bleached every time the trade winds arrive
